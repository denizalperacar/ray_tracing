# ray_tracing
This repository contains the implementation of the the first two books "ray tracing in one weekend", and "ray tracing the next week". 

The first part is implemented in C++ while the second part of the project is implemented in cuda. Also the image format is changed which speeds up the rendering significantly. 

The current CUDA based generated scene is:
